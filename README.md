# rustris
Simple Rust-based tetris implementation written with OpenGL(glium).

##Why?
Just for fun and deeper understanding of Rust/OpenGL. No commercial reason for it. 

## Requirements
I use freetype fonts, so you will need freetype library for your OS. And I was lazy enough to skip making release binaries, so you will need cargo to build this projects. Maybe I'll fix it one day.

##Installation
1. Download this repo
2. Execute `cargo run` in console
3. Enjoy =)
